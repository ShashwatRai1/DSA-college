Q1. While traversing a single-circular linked list, which condition establishes that the traversing element/variable has reached the first element?
Answer.
Lets understand the answer using the following example: 
    void printList(Node* head)
    {
      Node* temp = head;
      if (head != NULL) {
        do {
          cout << temp->data << " ";
          temp = temp->next;
        } while (temp != head);
      }
    }
In this example we are printing the circular linked list usign do-while loop.
When the iterator will reach a "node" whose next "node" is nothing but the "head" from where we have started our iteration,
the program will stop executing.
